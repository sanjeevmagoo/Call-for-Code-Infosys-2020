## Short description

### What's the problem?

In case of any crisis like COVID-19, communication systems are the first to overwhelm, when people are looking for authentic and timely information. As a result, it's the responsibility of the Govt to provide accurete and timly information to it's Citizens. It is important that the source of the data remains same while consumed from multiple channals so the same infmramtion flows regardeless of the channel selected by the end user.

### How can technology help?

Govt should expose the common APIs to be consumed by all the channels. The wrappers can be developed on top of these APIs so that multiple channels can be created. Soe of the channels we have tried in this Hackathon are:

1. Node.JS Website hosted on IBM Cloud Foundry
2. Whatsapp - Using Twillo 
3. Twitter - Automated posting of authentic Information on Govt of India Designated Twitter handle.
4. Alexa - Hey Alexa, How many new covid pateints in Delhi today?
5.

### The idea

It's imperative that learning and creating can continue when educational institutions have to shift the way they teach in times of crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Providing a set of open source tools, backed by IBM Cloud and Watson Services, will enable educators to more easily make content available for their students.

## The architecture

![Multi-Channel Crisis Communication Program using IBM Cloud Services](https://github.com/sanjeevmagoo/Call-for-Code-Infosys-Bend-The-Curve-Team/blob/master/Solution.jpeg)

1. The user uses multiple Channels to gain authenic Covid information from multiple sources.
2. A combination of IBM services like Watson, Cloud foundry, CICD, Cloud Functions come together to provide seamless information regardless of the selected channel .

## Project roadmap

![Roadmap](roadmap.jpg)

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```bash
dnf install wget
wget http://www.example.com/install.sh
bash install.sh
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be, for example

```bash
export TOKEN="fffd0923aa667c617a62f5A_fake_token754a2ad06cc9903543f1e85"
export EMAIL="jane@example.com"
dnf install npm
node samplefile.js
Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

And repeat

```bash
curl localhost:3000
Thanks for looking at Code-and-Response!
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why, if you were using something like `mocha` for instance

```bash
npm install mocha --save-dev
vi test/test.js
./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why, if you chose `eslint` for example

```bash
npm install eslint --save-dev
npx eslint --init
npx eslint sample-file.js
```

## Live demo

You can find a running system to test at [callforcode.mybluemix.net](http://callforcode.mybluemix.net/)
